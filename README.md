# Card_Data
Modeling a Library Card Catalog using C# .Net, Entity Framework and LINQ. Stay tuned for Updates.

Scope of work:

When looking for books for a library you can either use a card catalog or the main system which is either web based or an internal application. These applications can be cumbersome and very unfriendly. Design a card catalog backend using Visual Studio 2015 in C#. Use object oriented principles and Data Structures to showcase how the classes are linked together and build off of one another. If you have time a user interface could be a good addition, but this is NOT required. We are trying to see how you organize your code and how you think about solutions to problems.

Status:

This readme will be updated along with the project, as I intend to keep building it. It compiles, but is not where I want it to be by any means yet. The void main method does not reach all of the code yet, but I will have it reviewed and fix my errors. Over the last 48 hours, I have spent nearly 20 hours on this project so far. It has been an enjoyable, yet humbling experience. I was able to reach well out of my comfort zone and the more I work with LINQ, the better I will be able to use it.

Feel free to use this code for practice, build and expand on it, or destroy and rebuild it. I certainly plan to. Take care.
